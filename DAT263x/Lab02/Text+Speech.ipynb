Open another browser tab and navigate to https://portal.azure.com.\n2. Sign in using your Microsoft account.\n3. Click **+ New**, and search for **Language Understanding**.\n4. In the list of services, click **Language Understanding**.\n5. In the **Language Understanding** blade, click **Create**.\n6. In the **Create** blade, enter the following details, and then click **Create**\n  * **Name**: A unique name for your service.\n  * **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription.\n  * **Location**: Choose a location in the US.\n  * **Pricing tier**: Choose the F0 pricing tier.\n  * **Resource Group**: Choose the existing resource group you used previously.\n7. Wait for the service to be created.\n\n### Create a LUIS App\nTo implement natural language understanding with LUIS, you must first create an app; and then add intents, utterances, and entities to define the commands you want the app to understand.\n1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to https://www.luis.ai/.\n2. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription. If this is the first time you have signed into LUIS, you may need to grant the app some permissions to access your account details, and then fill in some information and accept the terms of use.\n3. If a message prompting you to complete a tutorial in which you will create a *Scheduler* app is displayed, close it (you can complete this tutorial later - for now, we'll focus on a simpler example).\n4. Click **Create New App** and create a new app with the following settings:\n  * **Name**: Simple Home Automation\n  * **Culture**: English\n  * **Description**: A basic home automation example\n  \n ### Create an Entity and Intents\n1. In the LUIS page for your app, in the pane on the left, click **Entities**. Then click **Create new intent**, and create a new *simple* entity with the name **Light**.\n2. In the pane on the left, click **Intents**. Then click **Create new intent**, and add an intent with the name **Light On**.\n3. In the **Utterances** page for the **Light On** intent, type \"*turn the light on*\" and press **Enter** to add this utterance to the list.\n4. In the list of utterances, in the *turn the light on* utterance, hold the mouse over the word \"light\" so that the list shows the value *turn the [light] on*. Then click **[light]** select the *Light* entity you created previously.\n5. In the pane on the left, click **Intents** and click **Create new intent**, to add a second intent with the name **Light Off**.\n6. In the **Utterances** page for the **Light Off** intent, type \"*turn the light off*\" and press **Enter** to add this utterance to the list.\n7. In the list of utterances, in the *turn the light on* utterance, hold the mouse over the word \"light\" so that the list shows the value *turn the [light] on*. Then click **[light]** select the *Light* entity you created previously.\n\n### Train and Test the Model\n1. At the top of the LUIS page for your app, click **Train** to train the application\n2. After the app has been trained, click **Test**, and then in the test pane, enter the following utterances and verify that they are correctly interpreted as commands for the *Light On* and *Light Off* intents as appropriate:\n    * *turn on the light*\n    * *put the light off*\n    * *switch the light on*\n    * *switch off the light*\n    \n### Publish the Model and Configure Endpoints\n1. At the top of the LUIS page for your app, click **Publish**. Then ensure that the **Production** slot is selected and click **Publish**.\n2. After the model has been published, at the top of the LUIS page for your app, click **Manage**. Then on the **Application Information** tab, note the **Application ID** for your app.\n3. On the **Keys and Endpoints** tab, note that a **Starter_Key** resource has been created for you. You can use this for basic testing, but for full functionality, you should assign a LUIS resource from your Azure subscription to this model.\n4. Click **Assign Resource**, and then in the **Assign a resource to your app** dialog box, select the following settings and click **Assign resource**:\n  * **Tenant name**: *Your Azure tenant*\n  * **Subscription name**: *Your Azure subscription*\n  * **LUIS resource name**: *The LUIS resource you provisioned in the Azure portal*\n  \n  \n5. When the new resource is added, note its **Key 1** and **Endpoint** values - you'll need these later!\n  "
